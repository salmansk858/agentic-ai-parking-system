# Agentic AI Frictionless Parking System

A production-ready multi-agent AI system for intelligent parking management based on the research paper 'Agentic AI Systems: Architecture and Evaluation Using a Frictionless Parking Scenario'.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive agentic AI architecture for frictionless urban parking using OpenAI Agents SDK, featuring:

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: 7 specialized AI agents working collaboratively
- **Interaction Agent**: Primary orchestration and user interface
- **Informative Search Agent**: Intelligent parking spot optimization
- **On-Route Guidance Agent**: Real-time navigation and routing
- **Access Agent**: Seamless parking facility entry
- **Micro-Routing Agent**: In-facility navigation
- **On-Spot Agent**: Vehicle monitoring and services
- **Departure Agent**: Exit management and payment processing

## Features

- ü§ñ **Advanced Agent Cooperation**: Augmentative, integrative, and debative patterns
- üîÑ **Handoff & Cueing Mechanisms**: Seamless agent-to-agent task delegation
- üõ°Ô∏è **Guardrails System**: Input/output validation and safety checks
- üéØ **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Transparent decision-making process
- üìä **Performance Optimization**: Based on research findings for latency and consistency
- üåê **Web Interface**: User-friendly parking assistance
- üê≥ **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS Lambda Ready**: Serverless deployment support

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salmansk858/agentic-ai-parking-system.git
cd agentic-ai-parking-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Configure your API keys in .env
```

## Quick Start

```python
from src.agents import InteractionAgent, InformativeSearchAgent
from src.runner import ParkingSystem

# Initialize the parking system
system = ParkingSystem()

# Find parking near Toronto City Hall
result = system.find_parking(
    destination="Toronto City Hall",
    preferences={"price_tier": "affordable", "ev_charging": True}
)

print(result)
```

## Architecture

Based on the IEEE research paper, this system implements:

### Agent Cooperation Patterns
- **Augmentative**: Multiple agents working on parallelizable tasks
- **Integrative**: Complementary agents contributing specialized knowledge
- **Debative**: Multiple solutions evaluated for optimal outcomes

### Interaction Mechanisms
- **Handoff**: Transfer of control between agents
- **Cueing**: Early context sharing for task preparedness

### Performance Optimizations
- GPT-4o-mini backbone for optimal latency/consistency balance
- Concise verbosity settings
- Medium prompt specificity
- Chain-of-thought reasoning for reliability
